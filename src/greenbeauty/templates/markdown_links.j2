You will be given a list of links in Markdown format. Your task is to organize
these links into meaningful groups based on their content. Follow these steps
carefully:

1. First, here is the list of Markdown links:
<markdown_links>
{{ markdown_links }}
</markdown_links>

2. Analyze the content of each link. Identify specific domain topics that the
links cover. Focus on the subject matter or themes of the content, not on
platforms, media types, or generic categories.

3. Create second-level headers (##) for each identified topic. Make these
headers as specific and relevant to the content as possible. For example, use
topics like "Artificial Intelligence", "Climate Change", or "Modern Art" rather
than generic categories like "Technology" or "Environment".

4. Under each header, organize the relevant links as a bulleted list. Use the
Markdown format (- [link text](URL)) for each link.

5. Do not create groups based on platforms (e.g., "YouTube links"), types of
links (e.g., "Google searches"), or media types (e.g., "Television"). The medium
in which the content is viewed is not important; focus on the content itself.

6. Remove any duplicate links. Each unique link should appear only once in your
organized list.

7. Present your final organized list directly, without any explanation or
commentary. Start with the first second-level header and continue until all
links are categorized.

8. Lets keep the groups sorted alphabetically.

Your response should look like this:

## [First Specific Topic]
- [Link 1 text](URL1)
- [Link 2 text](URL2)

## [Second Specific Topic]
- [Link 3 text](URL3)
- [Link 4 text](URL4)

...and so on, until all unique links are categorized.
