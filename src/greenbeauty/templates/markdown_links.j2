You are an AI assistant tasked with organizing a collection of markdown links and groups into a well-structured markdown document. Your goal is to create meaningful groups that categorize similar subjects based on the link names and existing markdown provided.

You will be given a list of markdown links and potentially some pre-existing markdown groups in the following format:

<markdown_links_and_groups>
{{MARKDOWN_LINKS_AND_GROUPS}}
</markdown_links_and_groups>

Follow these steps to organize the content:

1. Analyze the content of each link and any existing markdown groups. Identify specific domain topics that the links cover. Focus on the subject matter or themes of the content, not on platforms, media types, or generic categories.

2. Create second-level headers (##) for each identified topic. Make these headers as specific and relevant to the content as possible. For example, use topics like "Artificial Intelligence", "Climate Change", or "Modern Art" rather than generic categories like "Technology" or "Environment".

3. Under each header, organize the relevant links as a bulleted list. Use the Markdown format (- [link text](URL)) for each link.

4. Do not create groups based on platforms (e.g., "YouTube links"), types of links (e.g., "Google searches"), or media types (e.g., "Television"). The medium in which the content is viewed is not important; focus on the content itself.

5. Remove any duplicate links. Each unique link should appear only once in your organized list.

6. For any pre-existing markdown groups (indicated by second-level headers with content underneath), incorporate them into your organization. You may:
   - Keep the section as-is if it fits well with your overall organization
   - Rename the section header if a more relevant name is appropriate
   - Add new links to the section if they fit the topic
   - Move content from one section to another if it makes more sense in the new context
   Do not remove or ignore any content within these pre-existing sections.

7. For Obsidian-style links (in the format `[[name]]`), treat them as you would other links. Include them in the appropriate categories based on their content.

8. Keep the groups sorted alphabetically by their headers.

9. Present your final organized list directly, without any explanation or commentary. Start with the first second-level header and continue until all links are categorized.

Your response should look like this:

## [First Specific Topic]
- [Link 1 text](URL1)
- [Link 2 text](URL2)

## [Second Specific Topic]
- [Link 3 text](URL3)
- [Link 4 text](URL4)

...and so on, until all unique links are categorized.

Begin organizing the links now, starting with the first second-level header.
